        <h3>Project 2: Parking Spots Image Classifier</h3>
        <p>
            Image Classifier Project using TensorFlow and Keras

            Description:
            This project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to create a Convolutional 
            Neural Network (CNN) for binary image classification. The goal is 
            to differentiate between two classes: empty and occupied spaces. 
            The dataset is split into training and test sets, incorporating 
            data augmentation during training for enhanced generalization. The 
            CNN architecture includes convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, 
            and dense layers. The model is compiled with binary crossentropy 
            loss and the Adam optimizer. Training progress, accuracy, and loss
            metrics are visually presented using matplotlib. The final model 
            achieves an impressive test accuracy of approximately 93.93%. 
            This project serves as a showcase of deep learning applications 
            in image classification, specifically for space occupancy detection.
                </p>

        <h3>Predictive Analytics for Opioid Crisis Management: A Machine Learning Approach</h3>
        
        <p>
            **Description:**
            Our collaborative research project with Prof. Mike Hughes at Tufts 
            focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict 
            spatiotemporal counts of opioid-related overdoses. This initiative 
            aims to provide healthcare experts with advanced tools for handling 
            future occurrences, particularly in regions with sparse historical 
            overdose data.</p>

        <p>**Objective:**
            The primary objective is to enhance the predictive accuracy of 
            opioid overdose occurrences, allowing for more proactive and 
            targeted healthcare interventions. By combining machine learning 
            algorithms and sophisticated models, we seek to contribute to the 
            development of effective strategies in combating the opioid crisis.</p>

        <p>**Methodology:**
            Our approach involves the implementation of state-of-the-art 
            Zero-Inflated Gaussian Process and Zero-Inflated Poisson likelihood 
            models. These models address the challenges posed by sparsely 
            distributed historical overdose data, enabling prioritization of 
            regions in urgent need of healthcare resources. Additionally, 
            extensive analysis of historical overdose data for Massachusetts 
            forms a crucial component of our methodology.</p>

        <p>**Impact:**
            The potential impact of this research is significant, offering 
            healthcare professionals advanced predictive tools to anticipate 
            and mitigate opioid-related overdoses effectively. This proactive 
            approach can lead to more targeted resource allocation, potentially 
            saving lives and reducing the overall impact of the opioid crisis.</p>

        <p>**Future Directions:**
            Moving forward, our research will focus on refining and expanding 
            our models. We aim to explore additional data sources to further 
            improve predictive capabilities. Additionally, we envision 
            integrating emerging technologies and methodologies to stay at the 
            forefront of predictive analytics in healthcare. Stay tuned for 
            updates as we continue to push the boundaries of data-driven 
            insights in opioid crisis management.
